Welcome to MangaDex All Pages!
===================


MangaDex All Pages is a Chrome/Firefox extension which adds a long strip reading mode to [MangaDex](https://mangadex.com). The extension was made with CoffeeScript.

### How does this extension work?
The extension injects a script file I created into MangaDex's DOM. This allows me to access MangaDex's JQuery functions used to move between pages.

#### Where can I download this?
The extension can be found of the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/long-strip-for-mangadex/anjjhaohimjnndenopochpkdchdilccd) or on the Firefox Add-ons store [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/long-strip-for-mangadex).
